# WeaponSystem

This project is a demonstration of a weapon system for a multiplayer game, where all game logic is executed on the server and only the necessary information is sent to the client, ensuring an efficient and dynamic gaming experience.

## Features
- Server-Centralized Logic: All game logic is processed on the server, which sends only the necessary information to the clients, ensuring security and performance.
- Dynamic Weapon and Ammunition Creation: The system allows the creation of new weapons and ammunition with just one click, without the need to modify the inventory or adjust game logic.

## How to Play
1. Collect Items: Simply collide with weapons or ammunition in the game to add them to your inventory.
2. Switch Weapons: Use the mouse scroll to switch between available weapons.
3. Reload Weapons: Click "R" to reload manually or let the ammunition run out for the weapon to reload automatically.
